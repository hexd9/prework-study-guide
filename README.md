# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Study Guide was created for bootcamp students like myslef who are going throughj the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, GIT, and JavaScript. This Study Guide will serve as a foundation and allow me to include additional notes that will be taken as I expand my knowledge in becoming a full stack developer. 

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?
