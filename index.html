        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code. Example: var shape = "circle";</li>
      <li>In JavaScript, a string is a sequence of characters that is used to represent text. Strings can be written using either single quotes (' '), double quotes (" "), or backticks ( ) depending on the preference of the developer.</li>
      <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. Control flow can be interrupted, however. We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
      <li>Array is a data structure used to store a collection of values, such as numbers, strings, objects, or other arrays. Arrays are defined using square brackets [] and the values are separated by commas.</li>
      <li>/* comments out code */</li>
      <li>Function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
      <li>Math.floor() and Math.random() are both properties of JavaScript's built-in Math object that can be used together to generate a random number. 
       <br> var topics = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'Git', 'JavaScript']; <br>
        var randomTopic = topics[Math.floor(Math.random() * topics.length)];</li>
